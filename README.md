# Physics Lab 2.3 Data Analysis 

**Given:** 
  - 50,000 data points of time and signal strength 

**Goals:**
  - Approximate the nosie floor 
  - Approximate the peak values 
  - Determine the signal-to-noise ratio 

**Challenge:**
  - Come up with an formula or function that could create a pattern shown by the 50,000 data points


**Code:**
  - Creates periodic train of Gaussian pulses using Python and MATLAB
